# Custom Unaligned Temporal Dataset Creation for CARAT: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract

This report presents a detailed analysis of the development and implementation of a custom unaligned multimodal dataset that preserves temporal information for training the CARAT (Cross-Attention Relation-Aware Transformer) model on the CMU-MOSEI dataset. The investigation examines the inherent limitations of aligned datasets, the characteristics of CMU-MOSEI's multimodal features, and the methodological approach employed to create a temporally-aware unaligned dataset that maintains the natural asynchrony of multimodal emotional expressions whilst ensuring computational tractability.

## 1. Introduction

Multimodal emotion recognition systems have traditionally relied on temporally aligned datasets where different modalities (text, visual, and audio) are synchronized to uniform time segments. However, this approach fundamentally contradicts the natural asynchrony of human emotional expression, where visual cues, vocal intonations, and linguistic content may manifest at different temporal scales and with varying onset patterns. The present work addresses this limitation by developing a custom unaligned dataset that preserves the original temporal characteristics of each modality whilst maintaining compatibility with the CARAT architecture.

## 2. CMU-MOSEI Dataset Characteristics

### 2.1 Multimodal Feature Composition

The CMU-MOSEI (CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity) dataset comprises three primary modalities, each exhibiting distinct temporal and dimensional characteristics:

#### 2.1.1 Textual Features
- **Representation**: TimestampedWordVectors utilizing 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings
- **Temporal Resolution**: Word-level segmentation with variable utterance lengths
- **Semantic Content**: Contextualized word embeddings capturing semantic and syntactic relationships
- **Temporal Range**: Typically 10-374 time steps per segment, reflecting natural speech patterns

#### 2.1.2 Visual Features  
- **Representation**: VisualFacet42 comprising 35-dimensional facial feature vectors
- **Extraction Method**: OpenFace-derived facial landmarks and action units
- **Temporal Resolution**: Frame-based extraction at video sampling rate
- **Feature Components**: Facial landmark coordinates, head pose parameters, and facial action units
- **Temporal Range**: Highly variable (50-3,140 time steps), reflecting video duration and sampling frequency

#### 2.1.3 Acoustic Features
- **Representation**: COVAREP-extracted 74-dimensional prosodic and spectral features
- **Feature Components**: Fundamental frequency variations, spectral envelope characteristics, and voice quality measures
- **Temporal Resolution**: Frame-level analysis with overlapping windows
- **Temporal Range**: Most extensive temporal coverage (100-10,891 time steps), capturing fine-grained prosodic variations

### 2.2 Emotional Label Structure

The CMU-MOSEI dataset employs a seven-dimensional emotional annotation framework:
- **Sentiment**: Continuous scale from -3 (highly negative) to +3 (highly positive)
- **Six Basic Emotions**: Happy, Sad, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Fear
- **Annotation Process**: Multi-annotator consensus with continuous intensity values
- **Label Distribution**: Sparse emotional presence with predominant neutral expressions

## 3. CARAT Model Architecture and Alignment Requirements

### 3.1 Original CARAT Alignment Paradigm

The CARAT architecture was originally designed for aligned multimodal data, employing several key mechanisms:

#### 3.1.1 Cross-Modal Attention Mechanisms
- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Multi-head attention layers for cross-modal feature integration
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Assumption of uniform temporal alignment across modalities
- **Position Embeddings**: Fixed positional encoding schemes assuming consistent sequence lengths

#### 3.1.2 Contrastive Learning Framework
- **Prototype-based Learning**: Positive and negative prototypes for each modality
- **Cross-Modal Consistency**: Enforced alignment between modalities through contrastive loss
- **Temporal Dependency**: Reliance on synchronized temporal features for effective learning

### 3.2 Limitations of Aligned Data Paradigm

The traditional alignment approach introduces several methodological constraints:

1. **Temporal Information Loss**: Averaging or pooling operations within alignment bins eliminate fine-grained temporal dynamics
2. **Artificial Synchronization**: Forced alignment contradicts natural multimodal asynchrony
3. **Feature Degradation**: Collapse functions may introduce artifacts or lose critical temporal patterns
4. **Reduced Model Expressiveness**: Limited ability to capture natural temporal relationships between modalities

## 4. Methodology: Custom Unaligned Dataset Creation

### 4.1 Philosophical Approach

The development of the custom unaligned dataset was guided by the principle of **temporal authenticity** - preserving the natural temporal characteristics of each modality whilst ensuring computational feasibility for deep learning architectures.

### 4.2 Data Processing Pipeline

#### 4.2.1 Initial Data Extraction
```python
# Modality-specific feature extraction
text_field = 'CMU_MOSEI_TimestampedWordVectors'    # 300-dimensional word vectors
visual_field = 'CMU_MOSEI_VisualFacet42'          # 35-dimensional facial features  
acoustic_field = 'CMU_MOSEI_COVAREP'              # 74-dimensional acoustic features
```

The extraction process maintained original temporal resolution without applying any collapse functions, thereby preserving the inherent temporal characteristics of each modality.

#### 4.2.2 Dimensional Consistency Enforcement

To ensure computational compatibility whilst preserving temporal information, a sophisticated dimensional alignment procedure was implemented:

```python
def review_features_dim(features, target_dim):
    """
    Enforce dimensional consistency whilst preserving temporal information
    """
    if len(features.shape) == 2:  # Temporal sequences
        if features.shape[1] == target_dim:
            return features, False
        elif features.shape[1] > target_dim:
            return features[:, :target_dim], True  # Truncate feature dimension
        else:
            # Pad feature dimension with zeros
            padding = np.zeros((features.shape[0], target_dim - features.shape[1]))
            return np.hstack([features, padding]), True
```

This approach ensures dimensional consistency across the feature space whilst preserving the critical temporal dimension that contains the dynamic information.

#### 4.2.3 Temporal Preservation Strategy

Unlike conventional alignment approaches, the custom dataset maintains variable temporal lengths:

- **Text Sequences**: Preserved original word-level temporal structure (range: 10-374 time steps)
- **Visual Sequences**: Maintained frame-level temporal resolution (range: 50-3,140 time steps)  
- **Acoustic Sequences**: Retained fine-grained temporal dynamics (range: 100-10,891 time steps)

#### 4.2.4 Label Processing and Emotional Representation

The emotional labels underwent careful processing to align with CARAT's classification requirements:

```python
def process_labels(label_features, target_dim=7):
    """
    Convert CMU-MOSEI labels to CARAT-compatible multi-hot encoding
    """
    emotion_labels = label_features.flatten()[1:7]  # Exclude sentiment
    emotion_labels = (emotion_labels > 0.0).astype(np.float32)  # Binary thresholding
    return emotion_labels
```

This processing converts continuous emotional intensity scores to binary presence indicators, facilitating multi-label classification whilst preserving emotional complexity.

### 4.3 Data Quality Assurance

#### 4.3.1 Statistical Validation
The processing pipeline incorporated comprehensive quality assurance measures:

- **Completeness Validation**: Ensuring all modalities present for each segment
- **Dimensional Verification**: Confirming feature dimension consistency
- **Temporal Integrity**: Validating temporal sequence coherence
- **Label Consistency**: Verifying emotional annotation validity

#### 4.3.2 Processing Statistics
From the comprehensive dataset processing:
- **Total Segments Processed**: 22,777 multimodal segments
- **Successfully Processed**: 16,326 segments (71.7% retention rate)
- **Data Quality Issues**: 6,451 segments excluded due to missing modalities or corrupted features
- **Split Distribution**: 
  - Training: 11,256 segments
  - Validation: 1,835 segments  
  - Testing: 3,235 segments

## 5. Architectural Adaptations for Unaligned Data

### 5.1 Adaptive CTC Alignment Module

To accommodate variable temporal lengths, the CARAT architecture was extended with an Adaptive Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) module:

```python
class AdaptiveCTCModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_dim, min_target_len=50, max_target_len=400):
        super(AdaptiveCTCModule, self).__init__()
        self.in_dim = in_dim
        self.min_target_len = min_target_len
        self.max_target_len = max_target_len
        
        # Adaptive projection layers
        self.hidden_dim = min(512, in_dim * 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_dim, self.hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim, self.hidden_dim)
        self.final_projection = nn.Linear(self.hidden_dim, in_dim)
```

#### 5.1.1 Temporal Alignment Strategy

The Adaptive CTC module employs a sophisticated temporal alignment strategy:

1. **Batch-Adaptive Target Length Calculation**:
   ```python
   max_seq_len = max(orig_visual_len, orig_audio_len)
   batch_target_length = min(
       max(ctc_target, min(max_seq_len // 4, 300)),
       min(visual_max_pos, audio_max_pos)
   )
   ```

2. **Interpolative Alignment**: Linear interpolation to achieve target temporal length whilst preserving temporal dynamics

3. **Position Embedding Compatibility**: Ensuring alignment with transformer position embedding constraints

### 5.2 Variable Length Sequence Handling

#### 5.2.1 Dynamic Masking Strategy
```python
if self.aligned == False:
    # Dynamic padding and truncation for variable sequences
    if orig_text_len > batch_target_length:
        text = text[:, :batch_target_length, :]
        text_mask = text_mask[:, :batch_target_length]
    elif orig_text_len < batch_target_length:
        text_padding = torch.zeros(batch_size, batch_target_length - orig_text_len, 
                                 text.shape[2], device=text.device)
        text = torch.cat([text, text_padding], dim=1)
```

This approach ensures computational efficiency whilst maintaining temporal authenticity through intelligent masking.
