    "# Tutorial on CMU-Multimodal SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial on using ***CMU-Multimodal SDK*** to load and process multimodal time-series datasets and training a simple late-fusion LSTM model on the processed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we specify some constants in `./constans/paths.py`. Please first take a look and modify the paths to point to the correct folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by (down)loading the datasets. In the SDK each dataset has three sets of content: `highlevel`, `raw` and `labels`. `highlevel` contains the extracted features for each modality (e.g OpenFace facial landmarks, openSMILE acoustic features) while `raw` contains the raw transctripts, phonemes. `labels` are self-explanatory. Note that some datasets have more than just one set of annotations so `labels` could also give you multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there's a caveat that the SDK will not automatically detect if you have downloaded the data already. In event of that it will throw a `RuntimeError`. We work around that by `try/except`. This is not ideal but it will work for now."

The convention is to align to ***words***. Alignment groups feature vectors from other modalities into bins denoted by the timestamps of the pivot modality, and apply a certain processing function to each bin. We call this function ***collapse function***, because usually it is a pooling function that collapses multiple feature vectors from another modality into one single vector. This will give you sequences of same lengths in each modality (as the length of the pivot modality) for all videos.\n",
